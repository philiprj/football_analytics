    "# Model Callibration\n",
    "\n",
    "Model callibration is the process of adjusting the output of a model to better match the true probabilities. This is key for utilising an xG model so we can understand the probability of a goal being scored from a given shot. For example a shot with a 0.2 xG should have a 20% chance of being scored, with a 0.8 xG having an 80% chance of being scored. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally when MLP are trained the outputs are not calibrated to the true probabilities. This is where Platt Scaling comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Platt Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Platt Scaling is typically used for calibrating models for binary classification. It involves training a logistic regression model on the output from your original model using a separate calibration dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Scikit-learn library includes techniques for improving classifier accuracy through probability calibration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Platt Scaling (Logistic Regression) method: Fitting a logistic regression model to the classifier’s output probabilities is accomplished by this method. A calibrated probability mapping function from the original probabilities is established by using maximum likelihood estimation. With the assistance of logistic regression, Scikit-learn’s CalibratedClassifierCV class facilitates probability calibration.\n",
